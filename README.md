# Prefrontal-Brain-Activation-Pattern-as-Topoimage-from-fNIRS-signal
 The project title is "A Simple Design of a MATLAB-Based Function for Topographical Presentation of fNIRS Data ". This project is divide into two parts. The first one is the generation of brain activation pattern as topoimage from fNIRS signal using MATLAB. The later part is registration of the topoimage on brain surface image for better anatomical view to understand the activation pattern in detail and identify the oxygenated and deoxygenated region.
