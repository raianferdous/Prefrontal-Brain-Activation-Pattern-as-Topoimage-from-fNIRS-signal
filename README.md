# Prefrontal-Brain-Activation-Pattern-as-Topoimage-from-fNIRS-signal
 The project title is "A Simple Design of a MATLAB-Based Function for Topographical Presentation of fNIRS Data ". This project is divide into two parts. The first one is the generation of brain activation pattern as topoimage from fNIRS signal using MATLAB. The later part is registration of the topoimage on brain surface image for better anatomical view to understand the activation pattern in detail and identify the oxygenated and deoxygenated region. 


#Files Description:
HBO.txt = Oxyhemoglobin Data File consists 250 rows and 16 columns
fNIRS.m = Matlab file (Code)

How To Do:
1. Put the files in a same folder
2. Run the matlab code
3. Can select the specific data points by changing the [data=x(55,:);] here 55 indicates the 55th number data points and will generate topoimage for that data
